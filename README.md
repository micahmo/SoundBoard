> Left-click to select a single audio output device. Right-click to select or unselect additional devices.
>  
> Note that audio playback to multiple output devices is not guaranteed to be 100% synchronized. This functionality is not officially supported by Windows or [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio), so SoundBoard is creating separate audio streams to each device which have the potential to drift.
